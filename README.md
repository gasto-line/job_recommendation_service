## ProjectÂ Vision
Conventional jobâ€‘alert platforms rely on static search filters and sparse metadata supplied by the job poster, often leading to mismatched recommendations. **Automatic Job Recommendation Service** closes that gap by continuously training on your personal scoring of past job posts, enabling far more accurate and individualized suggestions.

*In the first release the system is fully selfâ€‘hosted and trains exclusively on one jobâ€‘board API, but the design keeps expansion and multiâ€‘user scaleâ€‘out in mind.*

## KeyÂ Features
- **Activeâ€‘Learning Recommendation Engine** â€“ A lightweight ML pipeline (TFâ€‘IDFÂ + linear model) learns from a 1â€“10 score you assign to each job post.
- **Endâ€‘toâ€‘End Automation** â€“ A GitHubÂ Action fetches fresh listings daily, ranks them, and emails the top 10 for scoring.
- **Streamlit Feedback UI** â€“ Oneâ€‘click scoring from any device; new scores immediately enrich the dataset.
- **Zeroâ€‘Ops Storage** â€“ Uses SQLite for simplicity while prototyping; interchangeable with cloud DBs later.
- **Modular DataÂ Layer** â€“ Distinct *raw*, *processed*, and *labeled* tables make it easy to iterate on feature engineering or swap in new sources.

## SystemÂ Architecture

to be updated...

### TechÂ Stack
| Layer | Tooling |
|-------|---------|
| Language | PythonÂ â‰¥â€¯3.10 |
| DataÂ Store | SQLite (soon: Postgres/CloudÂ SQL) |
| ML | scikitâ€‘learn, pandas, numpy |
| Scheduling | GitHubÂ Actions (cron) |
| WebÂ UI | Streamlit |
| Email | SMTP via GitHub Secrets |

## GettingÂ Started
### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourâ€‘handle>/automaticâ€‘jobâ€‘recommendationâ€‘service.git
cd automaticâ€‘jobâ€‘recommendationâ€‘service
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. EnvironmentÂ Variables
Create `.env` in the project root:
```env
JOBBOARD_API_KEY=xxx
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_USER=you@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=appâ€‘password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

### 3. BootstrapÂ Dataset
Run the dataâ€‘seed script to fetch the first 100 posts and start manual scoring:
```bash
python scripts/seed_dataset.py --n 100
streamlit run app/label_ui.py
```

## DailyÂ Workflow
1. **00:00â€¯UTC** â€“ GitHub Action `fetchâ€‘andâ€‘rank.yml` retrieves 50 fresh postings via API.
2. Posts are vectorized using the current TFâ€‘IDF vocabulary, and a predicted score is generated.
3. Top 10 predictions are emailed (HTML digest) and surfaced in the Streamlit UI for scoring during the day.
4. **23:00â€¯UTC** â€“ Action `retrain.yml` merges the dayâ€™s new scores into `jobs_raw.db`, rebuilds features, and retrains the model.
5. Metrics (MAE, topâ€‘10 precision) are logged to the repositoryâ€™s **ActionsÂ â†’Â Artifacts** tab.

## Data &Â ModelÂ Details
| Table | Purpose | KeyÂ Fields |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `jobs_raw` | Untouched API responses | `id`, `json`, `fetched_at` |
| `jobs_vect` | Sparse vectors & engineered fields | `job_id`, `tfidf_vec`, `years_exp`, â€¦ |
| `scores` | Human labels | `job_id`, `score`, `label_time` |

Current model: **Logistic Regression (oneâ€‘vsâ€‘rest)** on TFâ€‘IDFÂ + engineered numeric features. For a deeper dive, see [`notebooks/model_exploration.ipynb`](notebooks/model_exploration.ipynb).

## Roadmap
- **Multiâ€‘Source Intake** â€“ Add Jooble API and webâ€‘scraped boards.
- **AI Field Enrichment** â€“ LLM agents fetch job pages to fill missing metadata (yearsÂ exp, sector, technicality).
- **Coldâ€‘Start Mitigation** â€“ Start with a generic languageâ€‘model embedding and fineâ€‘tune as labels grow.
- **Public SaaS Beta** â€“ Dockerised backend, Postgres, AWS/GCP deployment.
- **Collaboration Features** â€“ Multiâ€‘user auth, shared or personal models, leaderboard.
